# React - Chat
## Front End App

#### This is a chat project that has been developed in ReactJS using Router and Redux.

It has been deployed in Netlify and you can find the access [here](https://am2-final-chat.netlify.app/ "here").

To try it out you can use Insomnia for which an insomnia file has been included. Or you may use the online documentation found [here](https://node-fullstack-squad4.herokuapp.com/api-docs/ "here").

You need to register either through a google account or with an email and password. The instant messaging feature is not working right now, so in order to see the messages received you would need to refresh the page.

Any comments or suggestions are welcome.
